# Advanced Technical Artist Challenge

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Make sure that you are using Unreal 5.1

## The Problem

We need a portal that can be used by players to travel between different locations/levels inside our app, players will use these portals to travel from our shared social lobby to individual stadiums/locations. 

We have provided a sci-fi themed "gate" mesh where we need to add a portal effect that includes the following: 

- Clear visual indication that it is a portal
- Fits the scifi aesthetic
- Clearly communicate the destination
- Incorporates "depth" in some way shape or form

This portal can be achieved with whatever technologies you deem suitable such as niagara, shaders and other visual effects or multiple in combination

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take a briefing and implement a full feature from scratch

This is not intended to be a complex feature rich system with every single thing paramatised and customisable, something that demonstates both your technical ability as well as time management and artistic approach with the tools of your chosing.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 2 days.
